# Hangman
Java Swing based hangman game that draws stick figures.

This is an experiment with an enterprise touch. It seems overkill in a small game like this, but
makes sense in enterprise projects with thousands of classes. 

The entry point is the Application class.

# Requirements
* Java 17+
* Maven 3.9.2+. Older versions may work but it is not tested.

# Disclaimer
This program contains satire and dark humor. If you are sensitive to this proceed with caution.
